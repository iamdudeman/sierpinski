I recently found out about L-systems and I have always had a fasciantion with Sierpinski triangles. Pair these two together and this is what happens. This is, simply put, a java class that is used to create Sierpinski triangles using an L-system. Starting at 8 generations the triangle begins to look really good. Simply have a Graphics2D object and pass it into an object of this class's draw(Graphics2D) method and enjoy the pretty Sierpinski triangle that follows. You will likely need to use the Graphics2D scale and translate methods to fully see the Sierpinski triangle.
